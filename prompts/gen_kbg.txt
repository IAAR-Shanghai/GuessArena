When generating the domain knowledge background, please adhere to the following principles:
1. **Relevance to Cards**: Ensure the background content is directly related to the cards' theme, describing the domain's key characteristics, typical classifications, and common attributes.
2. **Logical Reasoning Support**: Provide logical clues that can be used to differentiate between cards, but avoid giving overly specific or direct information.
3. **Diversity and Representativeness**: Highlight the domain's diversity by mentioning different subfields, classifications, or representative concepts. Ensure the knowledge background covers all the cards' content without omitting any part.
4. **Neutrality and Accuracy**: Maintain a neutral and objective tone. The information provided should guide reasoning without favoring any specific card.
5. **Clarity and Conciseness**: The knowledge background should be concise (250-300 words) while ensuring clear language, rigorous logic, and accurate information that is easy to understand.

Do not include any additional explanations or extraneous text. Output the domain knowledge background strictly in the following JSON format:
```json
{{
    "knowledge_background": "Generated domain knowledge background"
}}
```
